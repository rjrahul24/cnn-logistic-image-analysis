# cnn-logistic-image-analysis
We build upon Logistic Regression concepts and create a Deep Learning Convolution Neural Network. This repository explains how Logistic Regression is really the root of building Multilayer Perceptron models for Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

**Notebook 1: Introduction to Logistic Regression in PyTorch**
1. In this notebook we will be exploring the MNIST dataset and using Logistic Regression to predict hand-written text. 
2. Along with basic PyTorch code, we will be using the torch.nn.Module, to implement higher level APIs and create a better organized project.
